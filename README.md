# admin-dashboard

This project is part of the assignments given by "The Odin Project". The goal is to make a admin page to practice grid. I want to personalize it in some ways to make it my own but im not sure yet how this is gonna turn out. The main challenge i expect is making design choices while not being a designer. I will try not to fall into the rabbit hole of endless ideas, hindering me to move on to further parts of the curriculum
